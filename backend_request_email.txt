Subject: Requirements for Map Navigation & location-based AI Search

Hello Backend Team,

We are implementing a new map-based navigation feature (similar to Airbnb/Facebook Events) and improving our "Around Me" logic. To support this effectively, we need the following API enhancements:

1.  **Geospatial Bounding Box Search**:
    -   Current API (`GET /events`) supports `lat`/`lng` + `radius`.
    -   **Requirement**: We need support for searching by **Bounding Box** (`northEastLat`, `northEastLng`, `southWestLat`, `southWestLng`). This is critical for the "Search as I move the map" feature, allowing us to fetch events exactly within the visible screen area.
    -   Ideally, this endpoint should optionally return "lightweight" objects (ID, Lat, Lng, Title, CategoryIcon) for pins to render quickly, with full details loaded only on selection.

2.  **Address & Location Data**:
    -   Please ensure `Event` objects consistently return high-quality `latitude` and `longitude` derived from their addresses.
    -   Verify that the `location` field (JSONB or relationship) correctly maps these coordinates.

3.  **AI Tooling (`findEvents`)**:
    -   We want the "Petit Boo" AI to perform proximity searches (e.g., "Find activities within 5km of me" or "around my current location").
    -   **Requirement**: Update the `findEvents` tool definition to accept `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius_km` parameters.
    -   The system prompt should be updated to prioritize these parameters when the user provides location context or asks for "nearby" items.

4.  **City Filtering**:
    -   We are moving towards a coordinate-based city filter. When a user selects a "City" filter, we will likely send the city's coordinates and a default radius (e.g., 10km) or a bounding box, rather than just the city slug. Please ensure the API handles this well.

Let us know if these changes are feasible or if you have an alternative recommendation for geospatial indexing.

Best,
The Mobile Team
